# Codebook: ATP W144 Excerpt

## Dataset Description

This codebook describes the variables in the `ATP_W144_excerpt.csv` dataset.

This dataset is a random sample of **626 respondents** from Wave 144 (March 18-24, 2024) of the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP). The original dataset (`ATP_W144.csv`) contained 10,454 respondents.

This excerpt was created by:

1.  Filtering the original dataset to include only respondents who took the survey in English (`LANG_W144 == 1`).

2.  Selecting a subset of the original variables.

3.  Taking a random sample of 626 respondents from the filtered data.

4.  Converting all variable names to lowercase.
